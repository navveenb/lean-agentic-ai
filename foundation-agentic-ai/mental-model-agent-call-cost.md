# Day 7 – Mental Model: Every Agent Call Costs Money, Energy, and Attention  
*Build With Awareness, Not Just Ambition*

---

### Overview

Agentic systems are powerful — but power comes with a price.  
Each agent call, memory write, model invocation, or tool use has **cost**, **carbon impact**, and **cognitive overhead**.

**Lean Agentic AI** promotes a mindset of **resource awareness**.  
Before adding complexity, ask: *Is this step worth the cost — in compute, carbon, or clarity?*

### The Invisible Cost of "Just One More Step"

> “It’s just one more call”  
> “Let’s keep all memory just in case”  
> “Let’s pass it to another agent to double-check”

These habits may seem harmless. But when deployed at scale or across recursive workflows, they quickly compound:

| Action                        | Hidden Cost Factors                               |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Model call (LLM)             | API fees, latency, energy use, token count         |
| Agent-to-agent delegation    | More compute, memory, stack complexity             |
| Storing context/memory       | Increases size of prompts, storage, emissions      |
| Unused tool/model invocation | Pointless execution = wasted energy and time       |

### Real-World Parallel

Imagine every step in your workflow costs:
- 💰 money from your team’s budget  
- ⚡ energy from the power grid  
- 🧠 attention from future maintainers

Would you still include it?

### Lean Thinking in Practice

Before each step, ask:

- **Is this model or tool essential?**
- **Can this be solved using basic logic, rules, or static data instead of a model?**
- **Does this memory get reused — or is it just stored for comfort?**
- **Can this agent resolve the task without calling another agent?**
- **Would I include this step if I had to justify its cost and carbon impact?**

Often, simpler logic or rule-based reasoning is all you need — and far more efficient.

### Design Cue

> Treat every agent call like a debit card swipe —  
> Small, but trackable, and meaningful when repeated.

---

### Mental Model

> Every action in an agentic system has a price —  
> Think in units of **money**, **energy**, and **attention**.

Design lean not just to optimize performance — but to earn **trust**, reduce **waste**, and scale responsibly.
