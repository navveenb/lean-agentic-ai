# Monolithic AI Calls vs. Modular Agents  
*Choosing the Right Approach for Cost, Carbon, and Control*

---

### Overview

In AI workflows, you often face a design choice:

- Should you send a large, complex prompt to a single powerful model (monolithic)?
- Or should you break the task into smaller steps and route them through lightweight, modular agents?

Both approaches have trade-offs.  
**Lean Agentic AI** is about choosing the right pattern based on **efficiency, footprint, and control** â€” not just outcome.

### Monolithic vs. Modular: What's the Difference?

| Characteristic      | Monolithic AI Call                         | Modular Agentic Workflow                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**        | One large prompt â†’ one model call           | Multiple agents â†’ each handles a step       |
| **Efficiency**       | High upfront cost, low orchestration        | Lower per-step cost, but more overhead      |
| **Carbon Impact**    | High due to size and token processing       | Distributed and potentially lower           |
| **Control**          | Hard to audit reasoning                     | Easier to inspect and govern                |
| **Tool Use**         | Often no external tools                     | Can use specific tools or lightweight models|
| **Flexibility**      | Static, task-specific                       | Dynamic, reusable logic                     |

### When to Choose Monolithic

- Tasks that are atomic and donâ€™t benefit from breakdown (e.g., short summaries)
- You need speed and donâ€™t care about reasoning transparency
- You already have prompt-tuned results with high reliability

---

### When to Choose Modular

- Tasks that involve multiple decisions, memory, or tool use
- You want control, transparency, and reuse across workflows
- You're optimizing for emissions, performance, or fallback design

---

### Efficiency Trade-Off

> Monolithic calls can be **fast but heavy**.  
> Modular agents can be **light but layered**.

A monolithic call might seem simpler â€” but if it consumes 5x more tokens or runs a 65B model for a task solvable with a 7B, the hidden **cost and carbon** spike is real.

### Hybrid is Also Valid

Sometimes, the best solution is a **hybrid**:

- Use a modular agent to plan or filter
- Then make a single model call with a scoped prompt
- Or vice versa: use a model to create tasks, then assign them to agents

---

### Mental Model

> Don't just think "Can the model do it?"  
Ask, "Whatâ€™s the **cleanest**, **lightest**, and **most controllable** way to get this done?"
