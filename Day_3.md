# Day 3 â€“ Why Lean?  
*Understanding Cost, Carbon, and Complexity in Agentic Systems*

---

### Overview

Agentic AI systems are powerful â€” but without careful design, they can become slow, expensive, resource-heavy, or hard to manage.

**Lean Agentic AI** helps prevent this by encouraging designs that are not only efficient and sustainable, but also **responsible** in how they use resources, make decisions, and scale.

### Three Key Areas to Watch

To build smart and responsible agentic systems, focus on:

| Area         | What It Means                                        | Why It Matters                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**     | How much you pay for model calls, memory, and tools | Keeps usage efficient and affordable       |
| **Carbon**   | The energy used by models, tools, and infrastructure| Supports environmental responsibility       |
| **Complexity** | Steps, memory, and orchestration depth             | Improves transparency, trust, and control  |

When you balance these three, systems become easier to monitor, optimize â€” and govern.

### Common Signs of Agentic Bloat

- Calling large models for simple tasks
- Agents triggering each other without clear need
- Storing more context than necessary
- Chaining tools without checking their value
- Lack of decision boundaries or fallback logic

---

### Being Lean Is Intentional

Lean does not mean minimal.  
It means **intentional** â€” doing only whatâ€™s needed, when itâ€™s needed, and stopping when itâ€™s not.

It means asking:
- Is this model call necessary?
- Is this memory reused or just stored?
- Is the agent adding clarity or confusion?
- Is the system aligned with cost, environmental, and ethical goals?

---

### Mental Model

> Every agent, every call, every stored token costs something â€” in money, energy, or clarity.  
Design as if **every step affects someone or something downstream.**

Thatâ€™s what makes it Lean â€” and Responsible.
