# Day 3 â€“ Why Lean?  
*Understanding Cost, Carbon, and Complexity in Agentic Systems*

---

### Overview

Agentic AI systems can be powerful, but if not designed carefully, they may become slow, expensive, and hard to maintain.

**Lean Agentic AI** means building smart systems that use only the resources they need â€” nothing more, nothing wasted.

---

### Three Key Areas to Watch

To design efficient agentic systems, focus on these three things:

| Area         | What It Means                                        | Why It Matters                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Cost**     | How much you pay for model calls, memory, and tools | Helps keep projects affordable       |
| **Carbon**   | The energy used by models, tools, and infrastructure| Reduces environmental impact         |
| **Complexity** | How many steps, agents, and tools are involved    | Makes systems easier to manage       |

### Signs Your System Isnâ€™t Lean

- Calling large models for simple tasks
- Agents triggering each other unnecessarily
- Keeping memory that isnâ€™t reused
- Chaining too many tools for one outcome

---

### Keep It Simple, Keep It Smart

Being lean doesnâ€™t mean doing less â€” it means doing **only what matters**.

A lean agent:
- Knows when to stop
- Chooses the right model for the task
- Uses memory wisely
- Focuses on impact, not just activity

---

### Mental Model

> Every agent call costs something â€” in money, energy, or time.  
Design as if every step matters.
