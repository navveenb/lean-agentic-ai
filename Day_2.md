# Day 2 – Agent vs. Agentic  
*Understanding Autonomy, Memory, and Self-Awareness*

---

### Overview

Not all agents are agentic.  
In AI, the term “agent” is often used to describe a unit that performs a task — but **Agentic AI** involves a deeper level of autonomy, adaptability, and context awareness.

### The Difference

| Feature            | Agent                          | Agentic AI                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Control Flow**   | Pre-scripted or rule-based     | Dynamic and self-directed           |
| **Autonomy**       | Executes tasks when invoked    | Decides what to do and when         |
| **State Awareness**| Stateless or session-based     | Maintains memory and context        |
| **Adaptation**     | Reactive                       | Reflective and goal-adjusting       |
| **Tool Use**       | Limited to assigned actions    | Chooses and invokes tools or APIs   |
| **Examples**       | Retrieval tool, summarizer     | Research assistant, planner agent   |

### Mental Model

A simple AI agent is like a **function** — it performs a fixed action on command.  
An agentic AI is like a **collaborator** — it makes choices, adapts behavior, and learns from past interactions.

---

### Developer Insight

If you’ve used frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI, you’ve likely built **agents**.  
To design them as **agentic**, consider:

- Memory (short- or long-term)
- Reflection (revisiting outcomes)
- Goal decomposition (breaking large tasks into steps)
- Orchestration logic (deciding the next best action)

---

### Why It Matters

Agentic behavior unlocks intelligent automation — but without thoughtful design, it can lead to:

- Redundant processing
- Repeated mistakes from lack of memory
- Overuse of models or tools

Designing for **agentic behavior** means calibrating autonomy, embedding memory selectively, and managing tool invocations responsibly.

---

### Key Principle

> **Agents do tasks. Agentic systems make decisions.**  
Agentic design balances autonomy with control, memory with clarity, and intelligence with intent.
