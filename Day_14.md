# Day 14 – Designing with Cost as a First-Class Citizen  
*Architect for Efficiency, Don’t Just Monitor It Later*

---

### Overview

In most AI systems, **cost** is treated as something you measure after deployment.  
But in Lean Agentic AI, cost is a **design-time decision** — just like security, performance, or reliability.

Every model call, token processed, tool used, or memory retrieved has a cost.  
Designing with cost in mind helps prevent hidden waste and ensures your systems stay scalable and sustainable from the start.

At small scale, costs may seem negligible.  
But in real-world deployments, agentic systems often run **millions of model calls per day**, across workflows, teams, and clients.  
What seems like “just a few extra tokens” can translate into **thousands of dollars** and **significant carbon impact** when scaled.  
Cost-aware design isn’t just about optimization — it’s about sustainability and control at scale.

### Where Costs Accumulate in Agentic Systems

| Layer                       | Cost Driver                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Selection**         | Larger models cost more per token and per call  |
| **Prompt & Memory Size**    | Bigger context windows = higher token count     |
| **Retries & Loops**         | Repeating the same task compounds costs         |
| **Tool Chaining**           | Excessive delegation increases execution depth  |
| **Fallback Model Routing**  | Improper thresholds escalate unnecessarily      |

### Cost-Aware Design Principles

1. **Estimate cost per agent run**  
   Know the rough cost of each model or tool call before putting it into production. Use average token counts × price per 1K tokens.

2. **Design for low-cost defaults**  
   Start with rules, retrieval, or small models. Let heavier models handle only unresolved or complex tasks.

3. **Limit retries and recursion depth**  
   Avoid “infinite improvement” attempts. Set boundaries and fail gracefully.

4. **Be cautious with large memory windows**  
   Long-term memory and large context windows introduce silent costs:
   - Higher token count = higher model cost  
   - Increased payload = slower agent execution  
   - Archiving and retrieving = extra compute/storage cost  
   - Every downstream agent must carry this load forward

   Ask: *Does the agent really need this much context?*  
   Can it be **summarized**, **compressed**, or **forgotten** once processed?

5. **Implement per-agent and per-session budgets**  
   Cap how much each agent can spend in a session or decision path.

6. **Cache and reuse outputs**  
   If the same prompt yields the same response — save it. Don’t pay twice.

7. **Introduce cost checkpoints in orchestration**  
   At each step, ask: “Is this next model call justified based on the value it adds?”

8. **Track cost-to-value ratio**  
   Evaluate whether high-cost steps are producing proportionally valuable outcomes (e.g., accuracy, actionability, personalization).

9. **Design for graceful degradation**  
   If budget is exceeded, fallback to static output, human review, or basic logic — instead of letting systems fail silently or expensively.

10. **Simulate at scale before launch**  
   Run load simulations with expected user volumes to see where cost bottlenecks appear.

### Architectural Trade-offs

Instead of:

> “How accurate is the result?”

Also ask:

> “Was it worth the cost to get that level of accuracy?”  
> “Could we have reached 90% of the quality at 10% of the cost?”

---

### Cost Awareness ≠ Restriction

Being cost-aware isn’t about cutting corners — it’s about being **intentional with every operation**, from model calls to memory handling.

---

### Mental Model

> A one-token mistake might cost $0.00001.  
> Multiply that by 100 agents × 1M users/day — and it becomes a budget line item.  
> In cost-aware systems, every call is a choice. Design agents that spend with intent.
