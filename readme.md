# Lean Agentic AI: Daily Byte-Size Learnings  
**Designing Efficient, Responsible, and Sustainable Agentic Systems**

Welcome to the **Lean Agentic AI** learning journey — a growing collection of short, daily learnings to help you design agentic systems that are not only intelligent and efficient, but also **responsible**, **ethical**, and **sustainable**.

Lean Agentic AI balances:

- 💰 **Cost-efficiency** — through smart architecture and minimal compute
- 🌱 **Carbon-awareness** — through energy-conscious design and deployment
- 🧠 **Complexity reduction** — through clear workflows and modular agents
- ⚖️ **Responsibility** — by embedding autonomy thresholds, ethical tool use, and safeguards in orchestration

📖 For deeper strategies, implementation patterns, and frameworks, refer to the companion book:
