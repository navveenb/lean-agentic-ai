# Lean Agentic AI  
**Designing Agentic Systems That Minimize Cost, Carbon, and Complexity**

Welcome to the **Lean Agentic AI** learning journey ‚Äî a growing collection of byte-size insights designed to help you build agentic systems that are not only intelligent and efficient, but also **responsible**, **ethical**, and **sustainable**.

Lean Agentic AI balances:

- üí∞ **Cost-efficiency** ‚Äî through smart architecture and minimal compute
- üå± **Carbon-awareness** ‚Äî through energy-conscious design and deployment
- üß† **Complexity reduction** ‚Äî through clear workflows and modular agents
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Responsibility** ‚Äî by embedding autonomy thresholds, ethical tool use, and safeguards in orchestration

üìñ For deeper strategies, implementation patterns, and frameworks, refer to the companion book:

## Overview

This repository contains a growing series of byte-size learnings focused on building Lean Agentic AI systems.  
The goal is to help you design and implement AI agents that are not only capable and scalable ‚Äî but also cost-efficient, carbon-aware, and architecturally lean.

Each entry explores a focused concept, best practice, or design decision that supports lean thinking in the context of agentic AI workflows.
