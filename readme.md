# Lean Agentic AI  
**Designing Agentic Systems That Minimize Cost, Carbon, and Complexity**

---

Welcome to **Lean Agentic AI** ‚Äî a growing collection of byte-size learnings to help you design and implement agentic systems that are intelligent, efficient, and architecturally lean.

This series emphasizes:

- üí∞ **Cost-efficiency** ‚Äî through smart architecture and minimal compute  
- üå± **Carbon-awareness** ‚Äî through energy-conscious design and deployment  
- üß† **Complexity reduction** ‚Äî through clear workflows and modular agents  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Responsibility** ‚Äî by embedding autonomy thresholds, ethical tool use, and safeguards in orchestration

üìñ For deeper strategies, implementation patterns, and frameworks, refer to the companion book:

## Overview

This repository curates a living collection of byte-size insights, focused on designing and deploying **lean agentic systems** that minimize cost, carbon, and complexity.

It‚Äôs intended for AI builders, architects, and decision-makers looking to optimize how agentic systems operate ‚Äî with a focus on performance, efficiency, and sustainability.

You can browse topics in any order ‚Äî each file stands on its own ‚Äî or follow the two thematic sections to explore foundational concepts and design strategies.
