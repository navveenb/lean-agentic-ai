# Lean Agentic AI: Daily Byte-Size Learnings  
**Designing Efficient, Responsible, and Sustainable Agentic Systems**

Welcome to the **Lean Agentic AI** learning journey ‚Äî a growing collection of short, daily learnings to help you design agentic systems that are not only intelligent and efficient, but also **responsible**, **ethical**, and **sustainable**.

Lean Agentic AI balances:

- üí∞ **Cost-efficiency** ‚Äî through smart architecture and minimal compute
- üå± **Carbon-awareness** ‚Äî through energy-conscious design and deployment
- üß† **Complexity reduction** ‚Äî through clear workflows and modular agents
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Responsibility** ‚Äî by embedding autonomy thresholds, ethical tool use, and safeguards in orchestration

üìñ For deeper strategies, implementation patterns, and frameworks, refer to the companion book:  
[**Lean Agentic AI: Cost, Carbon, and Control**](https://leanagenticai.com/)

## Overview

This repository contains a growing series of byte-size learnings focused on building Lean Agentic AI systems.  
The goal is to help you design and implement AI agents that are not only capable and scalable ‚Äî but also cost-efficient, carbon-aware, and architecturally lean.

Each entry explores a focused concept, best practice, or design decision that supports lean thinking in the context of agentic AI workflows.
