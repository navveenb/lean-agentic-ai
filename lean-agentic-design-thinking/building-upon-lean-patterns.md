# Building Upon the Lean Patterns  
*A Living Layer of Design Patterns for Evolving Agent Behavior*

---

### Overview

So far we've covered foundational **design thinking principles** for Lean Agentic Systems â€” from avoiding loops and optimizing memory to managing cost, carbon, and decision complexity.

These were **base patterns** â€” foundational building blocks for designing lean workflows and orchestrations.

But agent behavior doesnâ€™t stop at initial design.  
As systems evolve, new patterns emerge: ways to make agents more resilient, purposeful, and sustainable under real-world conditions.

Thatâ€™s where this new layer begins.

### Design Patterns for Lean Agentic Behavior

This is a **growing catalog of reusable behavior patterns** â€” principles that go beyond structure and into **adaptive execution**, helping agents act efficiently even in uncertain, cost-constrained, or failure-prone environments.

These patterns are **modular**, **cross-cutting**, and meant to evolve.  
They can be applied at any layer â€” within agents, between agents, or across orchestration graphs.

ðŸ“Œ **Bookmark this section** â€” more patterns will be added as systems mature and new agent behaviors emerge in the field.

### Pattern Set

| Pattern                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graceful Degradation**       | Donâ€™t fail expensively. Fall back to cached, static, or rule-based paths.  |
| **Stateless by Default**       | Prefer stateless agents unless memory adds proven value.                   |
| **Avoid Redundant Reasoning**  | Prevent double calls across agents or tools for the same task.             |
| **Output Value Estimation**    | Skip expensive actions if theyâ€™re unlikely to add meaningful benefit.      |
| **Green Agent Personas**       | Assign cost/carbon-aware behaviors â€” e.g., low-emission summarizer agent.  |

### Applying These Patterns Across the Stack

- Inside agent execution plans  
- During fallback and escalation routing  
- In orchestration DAGs  
- As annotations in memory, retry, or budget logic  
- During agent persona definition and simulation

Use these to **layer behavioral discipline** over your base design â€” especially when agents interact or operate autonomously at scale.

### Mental Model

> Base design makes agents functional.  
> Behavioral patterns make them sustainable.

Agents arenâ€™t just mini-programs â€” theyâ€™re reasoning entities.  
Give them principles to behave with intention at scale.
