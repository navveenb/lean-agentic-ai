# Designing Agent Workflows That Donâ€™t Loop Endlessly  
*Avoiding Infinite Delegation and Wasteful Cycles*

---

### Overview

Agentic systems are powerful because they can make decisions, call tools, delegate tasks â€” and repeat if needed.

But without thoughtful design, they can fall into **looping behaviors** â€” where agents repeatedly trigger other agents or models without meaningful progress.

**Lean Agentic AI** avoids this by enforcing **clear boundaries**, **exit conditions**, and **fail-safe logic** across workflows.

### Common Looping Pitfalls

| Loop Pattern                  | Example Behavior                                       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Redundant Delegation**      | Agent A delegates to Agent B, which routes back to Agent A |
| **Retry Without Change**      | Agent re-queries a model multiple times on the same input |
| **Cyclic Task Routing**       | Agents hand tasks across multiple agents with no resolution |
| **No Stop Condition**         | Agent continues planning even after the task is complete |

### The Real-World Cost of Loops

Without limits, looping behaviors can lead to:

- Unnecessary model and tool calls  
- Increased energy usage and carbon emissions  
- Slower response times  
- Difficult-to-debug workflows  
- Higher operational cost

---

### Design Principles to Avoid Endless Loops

Before finalizing any workflow, build in:

- âœ… **Maximum step or recursion limits**
- âœ… **Confidence thresholds** for model retries
- âœ… **Loop counters** with alerts or caps
- âœ… **Fallback paths** for non-converging decisions
- âœ… **Context change checks** before re-triggering logic

---

### Ask Before You Loop

> Is another model or agent call **really necessary**?  
> Or is the system trying to optimize something thatâ€™s already sufficient?

---

### Bonus Lean Tip

Use observability tools or simple step counters to **track execution paths**.  
Repeated patterns may indicate unnecessary loops or inefficient delegation logic.

---

### Mental Model

> Every agent handoff is a decision.  
> Every retry is a cost.  
> Every workflow should have a clear path to resolution.

Design forward-moving systems â€” not circular ones.
