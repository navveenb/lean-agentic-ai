# Day 16 â€“ Visualizing Agent Paths: Decision Maps Before Code  
*Map the Logic Before You Build the Logic*

---

### Overview

Agentic systems are dynamic, recursive, and often non-linear.  
Unlike static functions or pipelines, agents can delegate, reflect, retry, or escalate â€” which makes their behavior hard to predict without proper planning.

**Lean Agentic AI** promotes **decision-first design**: before writing any agent code, **draw the map**.  
Visualizing the agentâ€™s reasoning flow helps catch inefficiencies, control costs, reduce carbon, and eliminate unnecessary complexity.

### What Is an Agent Decision Map?

A visual representation of how an agent (or group of agents) behaves across a task:

- **Inputs** â†’ What triggers the agent?  
- **Decisions** â†’ What choices are made?  
- **Conditions** â†’ What thresholds or checks influence routing?  
- **Models/Tools Invoked** â†’ Which resources are called and why?  
- **Fallbacks** â†’ Where does the system go if something fails?  
- **Exits** â†’ When is a task considered complete?  
- **Memory Use** â†’ What is remembered, when, and for how long?

### Types of Memory to Map

| Memory Type      | Role in Workflow                  | Design Consideration                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Short-Term**   | Used within a session             | Discard after task if not needed again   |
| **Long-Term**    | Carried across sessions           | Summarize before storing to reduce cost  |
| **Shared**       | Accessed by multiple agents       | Sync with caution; track read/write cost |

Mark memory points clearly in your map and ask:  
- Is this memory reused?  
- Is it needed later or just a comfort artifact?

### Carbon-Aware Prompts to Ask at Each Node

- *Can I avoid using a model here by applying rules or logic?*  
- *Is the model/tool I'm using hosted in a clean-energy region?*  
- *Can I swap this model with a smaller one for this step?*  
- *Should this memory be persisted, or is it disposable?*  
- *Can this sub-agent or tool be offloaded to a more efficient runtime?*

### Why Maps Before Code?

| Without a Map                          | With a Decision Map                        |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Hard to estimate cost or emissions     | Can visualize model/tool call frequency    |
| Edge cases emerge after deployment     | Edge paths handled at design time          |
| Retry loops go unnoticed               | Recursive logic is made explicit           |
| Complexity increases unintentionally   | Lean paths are reinforced early            |
| Memory and storage cost is invisible   | Memory decisions are scoped and reviewed   |

### What to Include in a Good Decision Map

- Agent entry points  
- Decision nodes (yes/no or scored outcomes)  
- Model/tool calls annotated with type and size  
- Thresholds for fallback or escalation  
- Memory use and type (short-term, long-term, shared)  
- Cost or carbon-sensitive nodes (tag with ðŸ’° or ðŸŒ±)  
- Terminal paths or handoffs

---

### Tools You Can Use

You donâ€™t need fancy tools â€” start simple:

- Flowcharts (pen & paper, whiteboard, or diagrams.net)  
- Sequence diagrams (for multi-agent flows)  
- State machines (for reactive agents)  
- Annotated prompts (to simulate decision trees in text)

---

### Design Tip

When designing agent flows:

> If you can't draw it simply, it's probably too complex to run efficiently.

Start lean. Add only whatâ€™s necessary to move the task forward.

---

### Mental Model

> Donâ€™t design agents by default â€” design them by diagram.  
> Every box on the map is a potential cost, carbon load, memory write, or failure point.
