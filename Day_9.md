# Day 9 â€“ Aligning Agent Memory Use with Real Needs  
*Store What Matters, Forget What Doesnâ€™t*

---

### Overview

Memory is powerful â€” it enables agents to recall context, learn from past steps, and personalize outputs.

But memory isnâ€™t free.  
Storing and retrieving context consumes compute, increases token counts, and adds to model costs and emissions.

**Lean Agentic AI** treats memory like a resource, not a convenience.  
Only store whatâ€™s meaningful, reusable, and worth the cost â€” and always look for ways to minimize it, especially through summarization.

### Common Memory Missteps

| Pattern                    | Problem Introduced                               |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Store Everything**       | Higher cost, larger prompt sizes, longer latency|
| **Never Access Memory**    | Wasted storage and retrieval overhead           |
| **Forgetful by Default**   | Recomputes what could be reused                 |
| **Memory as a Dump**       | No structure or cleanup = complexity over time  |

---

### Designing for Intentional Memory

Ask:

- **What does the agent need to remember to complete its task?**
- **Will this memory be reused across sessions or by other agents?**
- **Can this memory be summarized before being stored to reduce size and cost?**
- **Is the memory needed now, later, or not at all?**

Use summarization to distill long content into compact, actionable context â€” and only store whatâ€™s truly useful.

### Memory Types in Agentic Systems

| Type            | Use Case                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Short-Term**   | Context within a single session or task    |
| **Long-Term**    | Knowledge carried across sessions          |
| **Reflected**    | Lessons from past actions or failures      |
| **Shared**       | Memory accessible across multiple agents   |
| **Ephemeral**    | Stored briefly, then discarded intentionally|

---

### Carbon and Cost Consideration

Every additional token retrieved or stored:

- Expands the prompt sent to models
- Increases latency and compute cycles
- Raises energy usage and emissions

**Summarized memory** reduces token count, keeps retrieval efficient, and supports sustainability goals.

Lean systems prioritize **relevance over volume** â€” carry only what helps the agent act, in the most compact form possible.

### Mental Model

> Memory is not a trophy shelf â€” itâ€™s not about storing everything.  
> Think of it as a compressed notebook: only retain what helps you move forward, and make it small enough to carry.
